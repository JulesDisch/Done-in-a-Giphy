# Done-in-a-Giphy
The one where there's gifs. . .
For this project, I use the Giphy API, JavaScript, and jQuery to produce a dynamic web page that populates with the Yankee gifs of your choice. 
I have created a few buttons with current players names. When clicked, ten static images will populate below.
When the user clicks on any of the static images, the image will animate. Clicking the image again will stop the animation.
I have put parameters in place so that only baseball-relevant gifs will show.
The user also has the option of adding more Yankees. 
The user can type in the name of any Yankee player in the input box, and click "Add a Yankee" to generate a button for that player. 
If the user types the players name in lowercase letters, the produced button will show the player's name appropriately capitalized.
